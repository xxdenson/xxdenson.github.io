              <h2>Writing Example 1</h2>
              <p>The modern artist I am choosing to look at is Henry Moore, who was a sculptor from England that lived from 1898 to 1986. According to his website https://www.henry-moore.org. He trained to be a teacher and served in the British Army before studying art at Leeds School of Art and the Royal College of Art after that. The two pieces that I will be looking at specifically are Working Model for UNESCO Reclining Figure (1957) and Falling Warrior (1956/57). Both of these pieces are in the Art Institute Chicago.  I chose this artist because I felt that though I could understand his work without having to read a paragraph about it. For instance, the Reclining Figure piece makes me think of a woman bringing forth life. Though Moore worked in bronze, she seems to be made from earth and seems to blend in with a mountain. It doesn’t make a lot of sense, I know, but that is the feeling I get when I see this piece. Also, his pieces are modern and tribalistic at the same time. The other piece that I really enjoyed, Falling Warrior, was my favorite of the two. The title really explains the piece, but I still feel like I’m seeing an actual warrior that has been beaten and the fact that he is abstract enables me to see anyone as the warrior instead of a specific kind of person from a specific demographic. I thought Moore was interesting, because he was apparently really famous, yet I had never heard of him. </p>

  <h3>Robotic Prosthetics</h3>
    <p> &emsp;I’ve always been a pretty active person. In high school I was on the basketball team and when the season wasn't going on I would play almost every day after school. Whenever I worked, I would run to my after-school job to keep my stamina up. In 2011 I joined the Air Force and while waiting to go to training I wanted to make sure that I stayed that way. I would do push-ups and sit ups and run at least every other day. The older I got, the more I felt a pain that was growing in my knee. Finally while in training for the military I got to the the point that I could hardly walk. I was sent to a doctor, and the doctor told me that I had a bone tumor in my knee. The impact of running was making the bones dig into my ligaments. He also told me that more than likely I would one day lose my leg. If you were wondering how I felt at this time, I was devastated.</p>
    <p> &emsp;This is what got me interested in my topic, robotic prosthetics. Like I said, I’ve always been a really active person. I started looking into it some years back and I’d run across the ethical side of this. That is people using these prosthetics, not to fix something that’s broken or replace something lost, but simply to enhance themselves. While looking at these ethics I also ran across the second half of my paper and that is designer babies. I am going to be discussing the ethical components of people using technology to enhance themselves.</p>
    <p> &emsp;First I would like to talk about how these work. I will start with robotic prosthetics. There are several ways for them to work. According to howstuffworks.com, one of the  technologies used to control prosthetic limbs is called targeted muscle reinnervation (TMR). It is a very new method that was developed by Dr. Todd Kuiken at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago. The way it works is your brain controls the muscles in your limbs by sending electrical commands down the spinal cord and then through peripheral nerves to the muscle through an information pathway. lf you had a limb amputated the peripheral nerves would still carry electrical motor command signals generated in the brain, but the signals would meet  electrode that control the prosthetics. (science.howstuffworks.com)</p>
    <p> &emsp;Designing babies are just as complicated. If not more. Designer babies is a nickname that’s is given to the process of manipulating the genes embryos. This process can eliminate all kinds of birth defects and disease. The gene manipulation can also be used to make a child be born more aesthetically pleasing, make them taller, faster, stronger, or anything that would give them an advantage.</p>
    <p> &emsp;The way it works is we alter genetic material in a cell, using a technique called CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats). The DNA that makes up our genome comprises long sequences of base pairs, each base indicated by one of four letters.     (www.google.com/amp/s/theconversation.com/amp/editing-human-embryos-with-crispr-is-moving-ahead-nows-the-time-to-work-out-the-ethics)
    The pros of both of these technologies are great. With robotic prosthetics a person that lost limb could still function like those with all of their limbs. A person that has been born with a mangled limb could still lead a full functioning life. With designer babies, as I said earlier, diseases such as HIV, hemophilia, and leukemia. It is also said to be able to prevent deafness and blindness. So obviously both of these technological techniques have benefits that are awesome because they benefit humanity greatly. They help put people on an equal playing field which produces those that can perform to the best of their ability.</p>
    <p> &emsp;Ethically the pros of these technologies fall into deontological ethics. The humans that benefit are able to perform their duties. By “duties” I mean being productive, contributing members of society. Please do not misunderstand me. I am not say that those with disabilities are not valued members of society. I am just looking at them deontologically. Also the researchers and engineers that are providing the technologies are fulfilling a deontological responsibility. They are are fulfilling a duty to those in need of their expertise. The researchers and scientists in this instance are treating people ends to a mean. In other words, putting people first. I could also see the scientists and researchers of these technologies using moral ethics. Helping someone to help them definitely falls into that category, but the help is more deontological than anything, as I mentioned.</p>
    <p> &emsp;The cons of these technologies are more of a snowball effect. I think that it’ll start as a not so significant problem and eventually escalate. I will start my explanation by saying that neither of these technologies are cheap and are in fact highly expensive. This is the first point is a problem because this makes these products favorable to those that are wealthy. It goes without saying that wealthy people already have an advantage in life because their money opens up a lot more opportunities. So  giving them a biological advantage further drives a wedge between wealthier members of the population and those that aren’t as well off. Jobs will more than likely hire those that aren’t physically and mentally superior because of these technologies and this will further increase the wealth gap. Because people that aren’t as well off are making even less money, they really couldn’t afford biological enhancement. This process continues over generations. Like I said, a snowball effect.
    I know this seems a bit dramatic, but it’s hard for me to see things going much different from this bleak scenario until robotic prosthetics and CRISPR get more affordable. </p>
    <p> &emsp;Now let’s talk about the cons from an ethical point of view. I think that these cons also go AGAINST a deontological ethics code. I would say Immanuel Kant’s form of deontology in particular. When I think about rich gaining more and more over those not as well off I think about Kant’s categorical imperatives. Kant says that those of us that are “moral agents” which are just people that have the capacity to act morally should do so by following his categorical imperatives. His first principle says, “Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law without contradiction.” In other words, only do something that  if everyone did it, it would be ok. In my example it is not ok to create an advantage so great for one person through biological advancement that another person couldn’t possibly keep up. His second imperative says, “Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never merely as a means to an end but always at the same time as an end.” Though I can’t directly line this principle up with my scenarios, I can’t help but feel that creating what is essentially a separate society that is more advanced, goes against the spirit of this principle. The third principle says that, no person should be used because they are autonomous beings that are capable of logical decisions. People often ask Kant’s writings contradict themselves. My response, “no” because I think that the way that he outlines his ethical principles, anyone could follow his logical approach to ethics, they would only follow the according to the limitations that Kant perceives each individual of having.  Kant’s point on doing things because they are your duty, his categorical imperative, and his Kingdom of Ends all can be applied to both men and women. The difference would be that a woman's duties may differ from a man’s in some cases. In regards to the Categorical Imperative, a woman’s maxim would be chosen based on logic that has a foundation of beauty as opposed to a man that has a more “sublime” way of thinking of things.</p>
    <p> &emsp;I would like to use a less dramatic example to help to emphasize my point. Even in a more simplistic setting: a sports arena, there are some major ethical dilemmas. If there are players that have robotic prosthetics, they have an obvious advantage, they can be made stronger, quicker, faster, and may not even have to think in order to react. These abilities are all gained without the person even having to practice or develop any of this. None of these talents really would have to require any effort from the person receiving the abilities when you think about it.</p>
    <p> &emsp;Another example of an unfair advantage is a child in a school and this child is competing for a scholarship. Because of CRISPR techniques, they may have a better memory or just a better disposition for learning. The child that studied hard but just didn’t have that edge would miss out in a competition that they never had a chance to win. </p>
    <p> &emsp;In conclusion, as someone that will more than likely benefit from robotic prosthetics, I am for biological enhancement. The best way to make sure that this issue remains on a more positive side of ethics is to make it more affordable to everyone. If it’s not clear from my various examples, for any advancement for mankind to be ethical, it should be made available for all of mankind.</p>

        <div id="Capstone" class="tabcontent">
              <h2>Capstone Project</h2>
              <<h3>Purpose:</h3>
<p>Why are we doing this? We need somebody else that’s full time to work our backend systems. The storage sat for too long and never got upgraded. </p>
<ul>
<li>-	The DFS server is backed up, but Active Directory is not backed up and DC server isn’t backed up either</li>
<li>-	When everything crashed we lost our portal for the  servers. </li>
<li>-	Portal that we have now, doesn’t support our access points</li>
<li>-	Short handedness makes it quicker to order new access point as opposed to downgrading or patching. Plus it was time for an upgrade </li>
</ul>
<h3>Planning:</h3>
<p>When our servers crashed due to poor planning by a mistake by the previous IT team, our public WiFi went out stopped working. Upon further investigation Plan install AP’s</p>
<ul>
<li>-	Budget: Our budget is predetermined by the upper management</li>
<li>-	Approval was obtained by the IT Manager, Daniel Layne, and based on my recommendations</li>
<li>-	Install new switches</li>
<li>-	Install access points</li>
<li>-	Testing: Confirming that each is operational</li>
</ul>
<h3>Analysis:</h3>
<p>While we have our own network for our employees work devices, we would like to have a public Wi-Fi that could be used for personal devices. This could avoid unauthorized clients on our network. We would not like to create a Shadow IT situation, and someone plug their device straight into our network. </p>
<p>Also, as a school, we have many clients come in to take our classes that are parents, current foster parents, prospective foster parents, and state employees. We would like for them to have access to the internet for their personal use without giving them access to the network</p>

<h3>Design:</h3>
<ul>
<li>-	Switches need to be configured.</li>
<li>-	Site setup </li>
<li>-	Network setup: AP’s need to be adopted and assign each to the site the site they are at on the management webpage (AP Admin console)</li>
<li>-	Document ports for AP, Lab, and offices.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Implementation:</h3>
<ul>
<li>-	POE injectors, network cables, and Access Points will be installed </li>
<li>-	Clients will have to be adopted to site</li>
<li>-	Apply network</li>
<li>-	Set static IP</li>
<li>-	Confirm switch port </li>
<li>-	Confirm AP and switch access remotely </li>
<li>-	Assess signal strength of the APs and  making sure switchovers happen when I unplug the one that is operational</li>
</ul>

<h3>Maintenance:</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, equipment gets outdated all of the time and everything will end up needing to be replaced in the future, however these AP’s will need firmware upgrades regularly.</p>
