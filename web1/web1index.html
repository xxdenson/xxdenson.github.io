  <p>The most important goal of effective communication is clarity. Clarity is not the same as simplicity. Often, simple things are clear if the message is intended to be brief and small, but often the message is about a complex relationship that can only be presented with a necessarily large amount of data.</p>
<p class  = "alert">This complexity can be made to appear clear by effective organization and presentation and need not be reduced to meaningless “bite-sized” chunks of data, as simplification does.</p>
  
<p>Clarity refers to the focus on one particular message or goal at a time, rather than attempting to accomplish too much at once. Simplicity is often responsible for the “dumbing” of information rather that the illuminating of it.</p>
  <h3>Questions</h3>
  <p id = "question">Please answer the following questions below.</p>
<p>Explain the difference between “alt” attribute and the “title” attribute.
The “alt” attribute is used when a browser doesn’t support the image. It describes the image instead. The “title” attribute is the title of the image and may give a few details about the image, like the photographer.</p>
