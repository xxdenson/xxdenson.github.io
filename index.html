		<h2>Profile</h2>
		<p>I am a veteran with 9 years of combined experience, including specializing on the electrical and environmental systems on military aircraft, 
			and as a network administration intern.  The skills that I have gained from these dissimilar vocations have given me the invaluable attributes 
			of an analytical mind and an eye for detail. My competitiveness will give me the edge over anyone else in my field because I canâ€™t except being 
			anything but the best. This in turn makes me hard working, disciplined, and determined when it comes to my work. </p>
